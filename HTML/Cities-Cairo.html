            <h1>Egyptian Museum</h1>
            <p>The Egyptian Museum is the oldest archaeological museum in the Middle East, and houses the largest collection of Pharaonic antiquities in the world. The museum displays an extensive collection spanning from the Predynastic Period to the Greco-Roman Era.The architect of the building was selected through an international competition in 1895, which was the first of its kind, and was won by the French architect, Marcel Dourgnon. The museum was inaugurated in 1902 by Khedive Abbas Helmy II, and has become a historic landmark in downtown Cairo, and home to some of the world’s most magnificent ancient masterpieces.</p>

            <h1>Khan Al-Khalili</h1>
            <p>Khan El Khalili bazaar was originally built to serve as a mausoleum for the Fatimid royal family and was at that time a part of the Great Eastern Fatimid Palace, which was built in 970 CE. By the 14th century when the first Mamluk sultan ruled the country, the Black Death had ravaged Egypt – nonetheless, it continued to act as a major trade centre, and as a result, several commercial properties were constructed. By 1389 the original Fatimid cemetery had been destroyed in order to make way for a large caravanserai. The original caravanserai can still be seen at Khan El Khalili to this day although most shoppers have little interest in the colourful history of this charismatic bazaar.Instead, most locals are only interested in securing the best possible deals, in a place where haggling is the order of the day.</p>
